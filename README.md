Monday

Add an action sheet to the home view controller that gives the user options of choosing a photo from the gallery or the camera.
Create the gallery view controller that displays the photos provided in a collection view.
Create a custom protocol for when a user selects a photo from the gallery. The protocol method should pass back the UIImage they select and then the home view controller should display the photo.
Implement UIImagePickerController for the camera and allow the user to take a picture with the camera and then have the photo show up in the image view on the home view controller.

Tuesday

Implement core data and store at least 10 filters in your data store.
Create a collection view that displays thumbnails of the selected photo with each filter applied to it.
When a user selects a filtered thumbnail it should apply the filter to the primary image.

Wednesday

Incorporate the photos framework into your app. Create a separate view control that is used just for displaying photos fetched from the framework.
Create a way to get the selected photo from the photos framework back to the main view controller. Remember each photo is represented by a PHAsset. And you will want to request a new photo since the size will be much bigger for the main image view.
Get the nodeJS script I pushed to the class repo up and running on your computer, and open access your web server via a browser.

Thursday

Implement the pinch to zoom recognizer for zooming in and out of your gallery and/or photos frame work view controller. Make sure there is some sort of restriction on it, so i can't zoom in and out forever.
Plug in the AVFoundationSwift view controller provided in the class repo. Run it on your device and see how it works.
Implement a Linked List with Generics, and implement adding and removing nodes on the linked list.
